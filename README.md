- 👋 Hi, I’m @AirWrecka79
- 👀 I’m interested in gaming, IT security and anything my brain latches onto 
(be it whale songs or how to braai/BBQ the perfect steak 🥩 😄) 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Network Security A+ and how to find my way around GitHub
- 😃 Pronouns = She/Her
- 🔰 I've just started getting my feet wet in GitHub
- 🤓 Keen to dig around and just see what is out there in the ether 
- 🏃 I also try to keep fit by running (jogging would be the better descriptor...lol)
